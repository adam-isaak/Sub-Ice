## Sub-Ice: DEM-based semi-automized mapping of ice shelf basal channels

Mapping algorithm that returns ice shelf basal channels' centerline, outlines
and cross sectional profiles; based on surface expressions in a DEM. 
For now, please refer to comments in the code for details! 


 #### Input: 
  - digital elevation model (GeoTIFF)
  - channels' start and end points (through GUI or multipoint shapefile)

 #### Output: 
  - channel centerlines and outlines (figures and georeferenced shapefiles)
  - cross sectional elevation/depth profiles incl. channel edges (figures)
  - channel depth and width along centerlines (figures)


#### Getting started: 
1. Clone this GitHub repository to create a local copy of the code on your computer (or download and unzip). 
2. Update the user specifiable parameters in *config.m* as required. 
3. Run *map_multi_channel.m* using a recent version of Matlab (code tested in R2026a). 

That's it! All data required to map your first basal channels is already included. 


 #### Main scripts in this distribution: 
  - *map_multi_channel.m*:
    map one or more channels given a single DEM
  - *map_channel_timeseries.m*:
    map a single channel over different DEMs (note: this workflow needs updating, use map_multi_channel.m instead)
  - *config.m*:
    configuration file with user specifiable variables

 #### Directories in this distribution: 
  - *./functions*:
    collection of custom Matlab functions required to run main scripts
  - *./input*:
    sample [REMA elevation data](https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/rema/) and shapefiles with channel start/end points
  - *./output*:
    sample output (will be overwritten when running main scripts)
